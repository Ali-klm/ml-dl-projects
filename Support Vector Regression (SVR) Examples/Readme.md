Support Vector Regression (SVR) Examples
This repository demonstrates the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) with both synthetic data and a real-world dataset (Position_Salaries.csv).

Project Overview
Synthetic Data Example:

Generates random sample data.

Applies different SVR models using RBF, Linear, and Polynomial kernels.

Visualizes and compares the performance of each model.

Position Salaries Dataset Example:

Uses the Position_Salaries.csv dataset.

Applies feature scaling.

Fits an SVR model with RBF kernel to predict salaries based on position level.

Visualizes the SVR model predictions.

Dependencies
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

scikit-learn
Dataset
Position_Salaries.csv contains example salary data used to train and visualize the SVR model on a real-world dataset.

Usage
Simply run the Python script to see the SVR models in action and view the corresponding plots.
