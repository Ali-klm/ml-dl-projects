XGBoost Diabetes Classification
This project demonstrates how to use the XGBoost classifier to predict diabetes based on a given dataset. The model is trained and tested using a CSV file named diabetes.csv, which contains the relevant features and target labels.

Features
Data loading and preprocessing using pandas

Dataset splitting into training and testing sets

Model training using XGBoostâ€™s XGBClassifier

Model evaluation with accuracy metric

Visualization libraries included for further analysis (matplotlib, seaborn)

The diabetes.csv file should be placed in the same directory as the code to ensure proper data loading.
