Decision Tree Classification on Social Network Ads Dataset
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Decision Tree Classification model using Python and scikit-learn. The model predicts whether a user purchases a product based on features like Age and Estimated Salary.

Overview
Dataset: Social_Network_Ads.csv

Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier (Entropy Criterion)

Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

Main steps:

Data Preprocessing (splitting and scaling)

Model Training

Prediction and Evaluation (Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score)

Visualization of decision boundaries for both Training and Test sets

How to Run
Clone the repository.

Make sure Social_Network_Ads.csv is in the same directory as the Python script.

Run the code in a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment.

The model will train on the data and visualize the classification results.

Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib
