Decision Tree Regression Example
This project demonstrates the use of Decision Tree Regression to predict salaries based on position levels using Python and scikit-learn.

Description
The dataset used is Position_Salaries.csv, which contains information about job positions, levels, and corresponding salaries.

The notebook includes:

Data loading and exploration using pandas.

Training a Decision Tree Regressor from scikit-learn.

Making a salary prediction for a specific position level.

Visualizing the regression results with matplotlib.

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

How to Use
Make sure you have Position_Salaries.csv in the same directory as the notebook/script.

Run the code to train the model and visualize the results.

The model predicts the salary for a position level of 6.5.

Output
The code outputs a visual plot showing the Decision Tree Regression results and the predicted salary value.
