Mobile Price Classification using SVM
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to classify mobile phones into different price ranges using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Dataset
The dataset used is mobile_prices.csv, which contains various features about mobile devices and a target column price_range indicating the price category (0 to 3).

Project Overview
The notebook includes the following steps:

Data loading and exploration

Correlation analysis using heatmaps

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Train-test split

Model training using SVM (Support Vector Classifier) with a linear kernel

Evaluation of the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn
Results
The model achieves good classification accuracy on the test set and provides detailed evaluation metrics.
