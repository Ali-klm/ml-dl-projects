# Text Classification with Attention Mechanism

This project demonstrates how to build a text classification model using LSTM and Attention mechanism. It uses the IMDB dataset to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

## 🔍 Objective

- Preprocess and tokenize text data
- Build an LSTM model with Attention
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate performance
- Visualize attention weights

## 🗂 Dataset

- IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews from Kaggle

## 📦 Dependencies

- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install required libraries
2. Download dataset from Kaggle (`lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews`)
3. Run the notebook `Code.ipynb`

## 📊 Results

- Best accuracy: `XX.XX%`
- Model saved as `attention_model.h5`

## 💡 Notes

- Includes attention weight extraction
- You can visualize which words the model focused on during prediction
