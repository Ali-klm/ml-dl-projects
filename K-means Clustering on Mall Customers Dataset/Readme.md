K-means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset
This project demonstrates the application of the K-means clustering algorithm on the Mall_Customers.csv dataset. The dataset contains customer information including their annual income and spending score, which are used to segment customers into distinct groups.

The code performs the following steps:

Loads and explores the dataset.

Uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Applies K-means clustering to segment customers into clusters based on their income and spending behavior.

Visualizes the clusters and their centroids on a 2D scatter plot.

This visualization helps to identify different customer groups, which can be useful for targeted marketing strategies or business analysis.
