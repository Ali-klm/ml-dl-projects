Random Forest Regression - Position Salary Prediction
This project demonstrates the use of Random Forest Regression to predict salaries based on position levels using the Position_Salaries.csv dataset. The model is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

Project Overview
The dataset consists of position levels and corresponding salaries.

A Random Forest Regressor is trained using different numbers of trees (10, 100, and 300 estimators).

The model predicts the salary for a position level of 6.5.

Visualizations are included to show how the number of trees affects the prediction smoothness.
