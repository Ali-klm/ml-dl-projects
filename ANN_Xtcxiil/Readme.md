Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This project demonstrates how to build and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras to predict customer churn. The model is trained on the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset, which contains information about bank customers and whether they exited the bank.

Project Overview
The key steps of this project include:

Data preprocessing (encoding categorical data, feature scaling)

Building an ANN with two hidden layers

Training the ANN on the training data

Making predictions and evaluating model performance using accuracy score and a confusion matrix

Dataset
Churn_Modelling.csv: Contains customer data with features such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card ownership, active membership status, estimated salary, and churn label.

Libraries Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas)

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn
Project Goals
This project serves as an educational example of using deep learning (ANN) for binary classification tasks. It can be extended for further experimentation such as hyperparameter tuning, adding dropout layers, or using other evaluation metrics.
