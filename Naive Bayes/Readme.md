Social Network Ads - Naive Bayes Classifier
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm on the Social_Network_Ads dataset.

Project Description
The main goal of this project is to predict whether a user purchased a product based on their gender, age, and estimated salary. The steps include:

Data loading and basic exploration using pandas and seaborn

Data preprocessing (label encoding, feature scaling)

Model training using Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier

Model evaluation with confusion matrix and accuracy score
Requirements
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

How to Run
Clone the repository

Place Social_Network_Ads.csv in the project directory

Run the notebook file or script

Output
The final model outputs the confusion matrix and the accuracy score for the predictions on the test data.
