# Perceptron from Scratch

This repository contains a basic implementation of the **Perceptron** algorithm using Python and NumPy, along with visualization using Matplotlib.

## üß† About

The Perceptron is one of the earliest and simplest types of artificial neural networks used for binary classification tasks. This project demonstrates:

- Training a perceptron on basic logical functions (like AND).
- Visualizing the decision boundary for two linearly separable classes.
- Understanding how weights are updated using the perceptron learning rule.

## üìÅ File

- `Code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - The implementation of the `Perceptron` class.
  - Simple logical test (e.g., AND gate).
  - Classification of two synthetic datasets.
  - Visualization of decision boundaries.

## üîß Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
